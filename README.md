  - **Database password**
  - **Database name** *limesurvey* #Or whatever you like
  - **Table prefix** *lime_* #Or whatever you like

You are ready to go.

## Database in volumes

If you want to preserve data in the event of a container deletion, or version upgrade, you can assign the MySQL data into a volume which maps to a directory in your host:

    docker run -d --name limesurvey -v ~/limesurvey/mysql:/var/lib/mysql -p 80:80 crramirez/limesurvey:latest
    

If you delete the container simply run again the above command. The installation page will appear again. Don't worry just put the same parameters as before and limesurvey will recognize the database.


## Upload folder

If you want to preserve the uploaded files in the event of a container deletion, or version upgrade, you can assign the upload folder into a volume which maps to a directory in your host:

    docker run -d --name limesurvey -v ~/limesurvey/upload:/app/upload -v ~/limesurvey/mysql:/var/lib/mysql -p 80:80 crramirez/limesurvey:latest


If you delete the container simply run again the above command. The installation page will appear again. Don't worry just put the same parameters as before and limesurvey will recognize the database and the uploaded files including images.

## Using Docker Compose

You can use docker compose to automate the above command if you create a file called *docker-compose.yml* and put in there the following:

    limesurvey:
      ports:
        - "80:80"
      volumes:
        - ~/limesurvey/mysql:/var/lib/mysql
        - ~/limesurvey/upload:/app/upload
      image:
        crramirez/limesurvey:latest


And run:

    docker-compose up -d
